## Atom Portable for Windows
### Intro
Environment to build an Atom Portable distribution from scratch.

This means taking care of long path issues and other annoyances.

I have bundled my favorite MIT/GPL licensed packages ...  
*I would have loved to bundle [FoldingText for Atom](https://atom.io/packages/foldingtext-for-atom), but I can't as it is it is commercial software.*

### How it works
Hopefully as simple as (0!), 1, 2, 3 ...

Just open a CMD prompt in the repo, execute in order and hack away ! :stuck_out_tongue_winking_eye:

The build and package should work on Windows 7 and above (just like Atom itself)  
*Not tested on Windows 10 yet*

### Plans
This is my initial beta version.

First thing is to tidy it up

Enjoy :thumbsup:
